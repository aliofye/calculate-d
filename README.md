# calculate-d
Given `e` and `λ(n)`, calculate a value for d such that `d x e mod λ(n) = 1`

This is a script to calculate d in the RSA encryption formula. More info can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)).

## Dependencies
1. Get [python 3.0](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to the directory where you can find `calc_d.py`
3. Modify the values of `e` and the `λ(n)` in the script and save
2. Run the command `python calc_d.py`
